<p>this addon allows you to play online radio stations and save audio stream to file.<br>
Recording one radio station does not interfere with listening to another radio station.
</p><br>
<p>
In addition to Internet catalogs, it is also possible to add a local catalog with m3u files to collections.<br>
To get a local collection, you must specify the base path to the catalog in the settings.<br>
All m3u files in this catalog and all its subdirectories will be checked automatically.
</p>
<p>
<b>Warnings!</b><br>
Checking radio stations from collections is a rather lengthy and resource-intensive process.<br>
It is recommended to perform it in parts, periodically closing the window, and rerun it later.<br>
After reopening the collections window, testing will continue until all radio stations have been checked.<br>
Also, the health status of links often changes, so it is recommended to check the health of the link at the moment before adding it to the general list.
</p>
